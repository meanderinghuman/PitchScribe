## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run PitchScribe on your local machine.

### üì¶ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

-   **Python 3.8+**
-   An **OpenAI API Key**. You can get one from the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/).
-   The following Python libraries:
    -   `openai`
    -   `langchain`
    -   `smtplib`
    -   `ssl`
    -   `datetime`

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Configuration

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/pitchscribe.git](https://github.com/yourusername/pitchscribe.git)
    cd pitchscribe
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    It's recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Add your OpenAI API Key:**
    Open the script and find the following line to add your key.
    ```python
    # WARNING: It's recommended to use environment variables for production.
    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your_api_key_here"
    ```
    > **‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Do not commit your API key to a public repository.

4.  **Configure your email (Optional):**
    If you want to use the email feature, configure your SMTP server details inside the `sendEmail` function.
    ```python
    smtp_server = "smtp.gmail.com"  # Example for Gmail
    port = 587  # For starttls
    ```
    > **Note**: Yahoo is not supported. For Gmail, you may need to enable "Less secure app access" or generate an "App Password" for your account.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Use

Run the script directly from your command line:

```bash
python pitchscribe.py
The application will prompt you for:

Company/startup details to analyze.

Sender & receiver email addresses (if you choose to send the memo).

A filename to save the memo locally.

The script will then:

Generate a comprehensive investment memo.

Save it as a .txt file in the project directory.

Optionally, send the memo to the specified recipient via email.

üëâ You can also ask additional questions about the company after the initial memo is generated. PitchScribe will use the conversation history to provide context-aware insights in real-time.

üìù How It Works
LangChain: Manages the core LLM pipeline, from prompting to response generation.

LLMChain + PromptTemplate: Handle the creation of dynamic, structured prompts based on user input.

ConversationBufferMemory: Stores the session history, allowing for context-aware follow-up questions.

SMTP + SSL: Ensure the secure delivery of memos via email.

saveMemo function: Handles the local saving of generated memos for future reference.

üîÆ Future Roadmap
[ ] Enhanced Export Options: Add support for PDF and Docx formats.

[ ] Cloud Integrations: Connect with Notion and Google Docs for seamless workflow integration.

[ ] Collaboration Features: Introduce multi-user support for team-based memo creation.

[ ] Web Interface: Develop an interactive web-based UI using Streamlit or Gradio.
